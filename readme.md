# Executive summary
This report focuses on the Glass Identification dataset, which involves classifying glass samples based on
their chemical composition. The objective is to predict the type of glass, such as building windows, vehicle
windows, and containers, using measurements of various chemical elements.
The solutions presented in this report address the Glass Identification as classification problem through a
comprehensive process involving data retrieval and preparation, exploratory data analysis, and data
modeling using Jupyter Notebook.
The findings from this research suggest that with two classification model, KNeighbors and Decision Tree,
combination with Simple Hill Climping Algorithms have similar prediction accuracy which are and . The
findings suggest that the two classification model without selecting proper features will return to low
accuracy. Meanwhile, applying Simple Hill Climping influenced to high accuracy in classifying glass types.

# Introduction
The Glass Identification dataset presents a classification problem that involves predicting the type of glass
based on its chemical composition. This dataset, sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository,
contains measurements of various chemical elements in glass samples. These measurements serve as
features to train machine learning models to classify glass into categories such as building windows, vehicle
windows, and containers. The accurate classification of glass types is crucial in science, manufacturing, and
quality control processes. This report aims to explore the Glass Identification dataset, prepare the data for
analysis, and develop models to achieve high classification accuracy using supervised learning techniques.
Methodology
The methodology for this project consists of several key steps, each critical to developing an accurate and
reliable classification model. The process includes data retrieval, data preprocessing, exploratory data
analysis, feature selection, model training, evaluation, and tuning.
